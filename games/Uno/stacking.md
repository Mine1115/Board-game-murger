## Uno Stacking Variant

In this variant, when someone plays a Draw 2 or Wild Draw 4 card, the next player can play another card of the same type to "stack" the effect.

### Special Rules

1. If a Draw 2 is played, the next player can play another Draw 2, causing the following player to draw 4 cards.
2. This can continue, with each player adding 2 more cards to the total that will eventually be drawn.
3. The same applies to Wild Draw 4 cards, with 4 cards being added each time.
4. The player who cannot play a matching card must draw the total accumulated cards.
